## Scope statement

TrustGraph documents **traceable justification** in machine-consumable systems.  
The scope is limited to how claims are supported by evidence and anchored in authoritative sources.  
No evaluation, endorsement, or scoring is performed.

---

## Included

- **Claims and assertions**  
  Verifiable statements made about entities, datasets, systems, or publications.

- **Evidence artifacts**  
  Materials that can substantiate claims, including documents, registry entries, signed records, logs, and changelogs.

- **Provenance and attribution**  
  Information describing origin, authorship, custody, and publication context of artifacts.

- **Integrity primitives**  
  Technical means to detect alteration, such as timestamps, hashes, signatures, and transparency logs.

- **Relationship mapping**  
  Explicit links between claim → evidence → source anchor.

---

## Excluded

- **Product or service comparisons**  
  No tools, platforms, or vendors are ranked or reviewed.

- **Authority or trust scoring systems**  
  No numerical, reputational, or heuristic scoring models are defined.

- **Certification or compliance schemes**  
  Jurisdiction-specific certifications or legal frameworks are out of scope.

- **Sentiment-based authority concepts**  
  Popularity, reputation, or social trust signals are excluded.

---

## Boundary clarifications

- **Trust** is treated as *inspectable justification*, not belief or sentiment.  
- **Authority** refers to *source legitimacy and traceability*, not influence or endorsement.  
- **Verification** means *evidence can be checked*, not that claims are declared true.

---

## Terminology baseline

Primary source anchors are documented and versioned in `SOURCES.md`.
