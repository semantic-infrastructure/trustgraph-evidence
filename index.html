    <h1>TrustGraph</h1>
    <p><strong>Independent reference on trust, authority, and evidence relationships in machine-consumable systems</strong></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        TrustGraph documents how claims, evidence, and source anchors can be structured into
        traceable relationships. The focus is on inspectability, provenance, and integrity—
        not on scoring, endorsement, or certification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scope Boundary</h2>

      <h3>Included</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Terminology for claims, evidence, provenance, attribution, and citation</li>
        <li>Evidence categories such as documents, registries, signed artifacts, and logs</li>
        <li>Relationship types linking claims to evidence and sources</li>
        <li>Integrity primitives (timestamps, hashes, signatures)</li>
        <li>Claim → evidence → source mapping discipline</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Excluded</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Product or tool comparisons</li>
        <li>Authority or trust scoring systems</li>
        <li>Jurisdiction-specific certification schemes</li>
        <li>Reputation or sentiment-based authority concepts</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reference Model</h2>
      <p><strong>Claim → Evidence → Source (CES)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Claim:</strong> A verifiable statement about an entity or artifact.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> An artifact that substantiates the claim.</li>
        <li><strong>Source:</strong> A canonical authority defining legitimacy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The model is classificatory only. It enables traceability but does not express
        judgment or sufficiency.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Evidence & Sources</h2>
      <p>
        All definitions and boundaries are grounded in primary standards and protocols.
        A complete, versioned source list and mappings are maintained in the evidence repository.
